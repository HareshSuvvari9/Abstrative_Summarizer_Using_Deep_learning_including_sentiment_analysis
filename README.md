# Abstrative_Summarizer_Using_Deep_learning_including_sentiment_analysis


ITF - Insights from Text File is a abstractive text summarizer implemented in pyton.
streamlit was used to implement the application . 
pretrained deep learning (transformer) model with tensorflow as framewrk and t5-base as tokenizer and model to get the summary. 
The application also provide polarity of the text that is summarized .
we had used nltk sentiment vader to get the polarity results.


### To run the application :
streamlit run projecti.py

We ca limit the number of words required after summarisation can be adjusted using scroll bar and the summarized data can be downloaded.

### Packages used in this project 

1.streamlit
2.pandas
3.nltk.sentiment.vader
